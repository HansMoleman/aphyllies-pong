The following objectives are intended to be completed during the first iteration:

* Define the project and its goals within the vision document

* Develop an overall iteration plan that briefly outlines the intended iterations and their order, as well as what they each (generally) intend to accomplish
* Create a design class diagram that maps out the system as implemented during this iteration
* Create a GUI design prototype that includes relative dimensions and positions of the graphical contents
* Develop a minimal working prototype of the system which implements 2-3 use cases identified during this iteration
* Develop a plan for the next iteration (below)
